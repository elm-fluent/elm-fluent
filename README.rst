`Fluent <https://projectfluent.org/>`_ i18n solution for Elm


Fluent is a next-generation translation/localization solution, designed by the
folks at Mozilla, and extracted from their l20n solution to be a re-usable
specification.

elm-fluent is a full implementation of this specification for Elm. It operates
as a command line tool that compiles ``.ftl`` files to Elm files. The result is
that each message becomes a function that will generate a translated string (or
HTML fragment) for a given locale and an optional set of strongly typed
parameters (string, dates or numbers).

Dates and numbers can also be passed with formatting parameters supplied - for
example, to attach a currency to a number, so that it can be correctly formatted
as a currency according to the rules of the locale in use.

Please see the `docs
<https://elm-fluent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for more
information.

Status
------

* Rough around the edges, but usable
* A pretty complete test suite
* Compatibility: Elm 0.18 only at the moment.
* Free software: MIT license


Main TODO items
---------------

* DONE: Complete compiler for Fluent 0.6 syntax
* DONE: NUMBER and DATETIME builtin functions (using `elm-intl <https://github.com/vanwagonet/elm-intl>`_,
  which means you need `elm-github-install <https://github.com/gdotdesign/elm-github-install/>`_ to install at the moment.
* DONE: Mechanism for HTML messages, with attaching of event handlers or other arbitrary Attributes to nodes
* DONE: Good error handling for all errors in FTL files
* TODO: Docs!!!

elm-fluent is a `Fluent <https://projectfluent.org/>`_ implementation for Elm.

Fluent is a next-generation translation/localization solution, designed by the
folks at Mozilla, based on many years of experience with localizing into a large
number of different languages. Mozilla have extracted parts of their 'l20n'
solution (used by apps like Firefox and Thunderbird) into a re-usable
specification designed specifically for the web.

elm-fluent is a full implementation of this specification for Elm (currently
supporting the Fluent 0.6 syntax).

It operates as a command line tool that compiles ``.ftl`` files to ``.elm``
files. The result is that each message becomes a function that will generate a
translated string (or HTML fragment) for a given locale and an optional set of
strongly typed parameters (string, dates or numbers).

Dates and numbers can also be passed with formatting parameters supplied - for
example, to attach a currency to a number, so that it can be correctly formatted
as a currency according to the rules of the locale in use.

Please see the `docs
<https://elm-fluent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for more
information.
